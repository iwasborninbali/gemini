gcloud command to lookup api key project
2025-05-07 03:21:13,523 - INFO - Perplexity research result:
To find the project associated with an API key using gcloud, use the `lookup` command followed by the key string:

```bash
gcloud services api-keys lookup YOUR_API_KEY_STRING
```

This returns the resource name in the format:  
`projects/PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/keys/KEY_ID`

Key details from the implementation:
- The command only requires the key string itself as input[2]
- Shows the full resource path including the numeric project number[2]
- Works for both active and deleted keys (if combined with `--show-deleted` flag)[1]

To get the human-readable project ID from the numeric project number:  
```bash
gcloud projects describe PROJECT_NUMBER --format="value(projectId)"
```

This approach is recommended in Google's official CLI documentation[2][5] and avoids security risks of listing all keys. For production environments, consider using secret management systems instead of raw API keys[3].
